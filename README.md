# iTerm2 

These are my iTerm2 Preferences and supporting themes, profiles, etc.

# Install

Just clone these somewhere, e.g. `~/Dropbox` and tell iTerm to use the folder for preferences.

## Theme

![](.github/screenshot.png)

If you want to install just the theme I use, just impor the theme in `Extra/Active Color Scheme/aubreypwd.itermcolors`.

## Profile

If you want to import my terminal profile, just import (using the `[+]` button) `Extra/Profiles/aubreypwd.json`.

## Mac Terminal Theme

I sometimes have to use the Mac builtin Terminal, and I have a matching theme in `Extra/Mac Terminal Profile (Matching)/aubreypwd.terminal` you can import by opening the file.
